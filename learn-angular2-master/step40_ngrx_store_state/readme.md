First lets get a overview of how to manage state with Ngrx/store. 

Read this upto section "The Sample Application" i.e. stop reading before this section:

Than Watch this video:

To add @ngrx/store follow these instructions:

https://github.com/ngrx/store


Now that we have a little background we will implement this:

There are four kinds of architecture we can use to store application state in Angular 2:

1. Traditional architecture where state is stored in plain JS objects inside components

https://github.com/panacloud/learn-angular2/tree/master/step04_binding_properties

2. RxJS architecture where RxJS is used to manage state 

https://github.com/panacloud/learn-angular2/tree/master/step37_rxjs_states_startwith_scan

3. Redux architecture where NgRx/Store is used to manage state. We prefer to use it when using with REST based server API's.

This step shows the redux architecture.

4. AngularFire2/RxJS architecture where we have realtime data stored in Firebase.
